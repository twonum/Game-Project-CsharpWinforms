## Multi-Functional Game Project

### Description

The Multi-Functional Game Project is a collection of four games developed using C# WinForms, each offering a unique gaming experience. These games include a Car Game, Balloon Game, Whirly Ghost, and Reach the Castle Game, each with its own storyline, characters, and objectives. The project was created by Muhammad Taha Saleem & 2022-cs-139 Object Oriented Programming as part of an Object-Oriented Programming course.

### Car Game

The Car Game is the main attraction of the project. It features a player car and four enemy cars with distinct behaviors such as random movement, smart chasing, and firing bullets. The player's objective is to destroy the horizontal enemy car while avoiding collisions with other cars.

### Balloon Game

In the Balloon Game, players control a character equipped with a bow and arrow. The goal is to shoot balloons generated randomly until reaching a score of 50.

### Whirly Ghost

Whirly Ghost challenges players to navigate a character through randomly generated hurdles using left-right movement controls. The objective is to cross 35 hurdles without any shooting system.

### Reach the Castle Game

In Reach the Castle Game, players control a character tasked with running and jumping over randomly generated hurdles. By collecting pallets and reaching a score of 50, players can uncover a hidden castle and ultimately reach it by crossing more hurdles.

### Game Development

All games in the project were developed using C# WinForms, providing a graphical user interface for an engaging gaming experience.
